## 2. Key Architecture Decisions

### 2.1 ✅ Approved Decisions

1. **Modular Adapter Pattern**: Pluggable database adapters with unified interface
2. **RAG-First AI**: Documentation-grounded AI responses to reduce hallucinations
3. **Template-Based Anonymization**: Preserve query structure while protecting data
4. **VSCode-Native Integration**: Leverage VSCode LM API and Chat API
5. **Performance Schema Primary**: MySQL 8.0+ Performance Schema for profiling
6. **GA-Only Support**: Focus on supported database versions only
7. **Security-First Design**: Credential isolation, production safeguards
8. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Pub-sub pattern for loose coupling

### 2.2 🔄 Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Dependency Injection** | Service Container | Testability, loose coupling |
| **Adapter Pattern** | Database adapters | Multi-database support |
| **Observer Pattern** | Event bus | Decoupled components |
| **Factory Pattern** | Adapter creation | Dynamic adapter instantiation |
| **Strategy Pattern** | RAG engines | Phase-based implementation |
| **Template Method** | Webview providers | Consistent webview lifecycle |

```

### 3.2 Data Flow Architecture
```
User Query → Query Service → Anonymization → RAG Context → AI Analysis → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Tree View ← Connection Manager ← Database Adapter ← Performance Schema ← Metrics
```

### 3.3 Security Architecture
```
Credentials (SecretStorage) → Connection Manager → Database Adapter
     ↓                              ↓                    ↓
Audit Logger ← Safety Validator ← Query Templater → AI Service
```
