## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1.x.x (latest) | ‚úÖ Fully supported | -              |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Security fixes only | TBD            |
| 0.x.x (beta) | ‚ùå No longer supported | 2025-12-01     |

**Current Version**: Check the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/mydba/releases) page for the latest version.

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest stable version to benefit from the latest security patches.

### Database GA Support Policy

MyDBA supports only GA (Generally Available) database versions:

| Database | Supported |
|----------|-----------|
| MySQL | 8.0+, 8.4, 9.x+ |
| MariaDB | 10.6 LTS, 10.11 LTS, 11.x+ |

EOL versions such as MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.4/10.5 are not supported. This policy reduces security risk and enables Performance Schema‚Äìbased profiling recommended by MySQL.

### Cloud IAM Least-Privilege (AWS RDS/Aurora)

- Use `rds-db:connect` with scoped DB resource ARNs for IAM authentication.
- Optional: retrieval of secrets via AWS Secrets Manager requires only `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` for specific ARNs.
- Do not grant wildcard privileges. Scope policies per environment and account.

### Dependency Hygiene

- Monthly dependency audit (`npm audit`, Snyk)
- Quarterly threat model review covering AI data flows, webviews, and database adapters

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please DO NOT Report Security Vulnerabilities Publicly

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not** open a public GitHub issue. This helps protect users until a fix is available.

### How to Report

**Email**: security@mydba.dev

**PGP Key**: [Download public key](https://mydba.dev/security/pgp-key.asc) (optional, for encrypted communication)

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

1. **Vulnerability Description**:
   - Type of vulnerability (e.g., credential leak, SQL injection, XSS)
   - Affected component(s)
   - Severity assessment (low, medium, high, critical)

2. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any special configuration required
   - Screenshots or video (if applicable)

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - What data could be exposed?
   - What actions could an attacker perform?
   - Are there any prerequisites for exploitation?

4. **Proof of Concept** (if available):
   - Code snippet or sample exploit
   - Environment details (OS, VSCode version, MyDBA version)

5. **Suggested Fix** (optional):
   - If you have ideas on how to fix the issue

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Credential Exposure in Connection Config

Description:
Database credentials are logged in plaintext when connection fails
with debug logging enabled.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable debug logging: "mydba.logging.level": "debug"
2. Attempt connection with invalid credentials
3. Check VSCode Output panel ‚Üí MyDBA Debug
4. Credentials visible in log: "Failed to connect: user=admin, password=secret123"

Impact:
- Credentials exposed to anyone with access to VSCode logs
- Affects all users with debug logging enabled
- Severity: HIGH

Environment:
- MyDBA version: 1.0.0
- VSCode version: 1.85.0
- OS: macOS 14.0

Suggested Fix:
Mask password in error logs:
```typescript
logger.debug(`Failed to connect: user=${user}, password=***`);
```

Proof of Concept:
[Attached screenshot showing plaintext password in logs]
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Credential Management

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Use VSCode SecretStorage for credentials (automatic in MyDBA)
- Enable SSH tunneling for remote connections
- Use SSL/TLS for database connections
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use read-only database users when possible

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Store passwords in workspace settings
- Share connection profiles with credentials
- Commit connection configs to Git
- Use production credentials in development

#### 2. AI Features

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Review the [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md) before enabling AI
- Enable anonymization: `"mydba.ai.anonymizeData": true`
- Use `confirmBeforeSend` for sensitive environments
- Disable AI entirely for HIPAA/PCI-DSS data: `"mydba.ai.enabled": false`

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Send production queries to AI without anonymization
- Include PII in queries when AI is enabled
- Use AI features on databases with regulated data (unless reviewed by compliance)

#### 3. Network Security

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Verify SSL certificates: `"mydba.ssl.rejectUnauthorized": true`
- Use firewalls to restrict database access
- Monitor the network activity log: `View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí MyDBA - Network`
- Use VPN or SSH tunnels for remote databases

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Disable SSL certificate validation in production
- Expose database ports to the public internet
- Ignore network activity warnings

#### 4. Extension Updates

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Enable auto-updates in VSCode
- Review release notes for security fixes
- Update promptly when security patches are released
- Subscribe to security advisories

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Ignore update notifications
- Pin to old versions without a reason
- Disable extension updates

### For Contributors

#### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input
   - Sanitize data before SQL queries (use parameterized queries)
   - Validate configuration values

2. **Credential Handling**
   - Never log credentials (even in debug mode)
   - Use VSCode SecretStorage API exclusively
   - Wipe credentials from memory after use
   - Never include credentials in error messages

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
   - Never concatenate user input into SQL
   - Validate table/column names against schema

   **Good**:
   ```typescript
   const result = await connection.query(
     'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
     [userId]
   );
   ```

   **Bad**:
   ```typescript
   const result = await connection.query(
     `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`  // ‚ùå SQL injection risk
   );
   ```

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Run `npm audit` before every PR
   - Keep dependencies up-to-date
   - Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities
   - Use Snyk or similar tools for scanning

5. **Secrets in Code**
   - Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
   - Scan commits with `git-secrets` or similar tools

6. **Webview Security**
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Sanitize HTML content
   - Avoid `eval()` or dynamic code execution
   - Validate all messages from webviews

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. VSCode Extension Permissions

MyDBA requires the following VSCode permissions:

| Permission | Why Needed | Risk Level |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Network Access** | Connect to databases, AI API | Medium |
| **SecretStorage** | Store credentials securely | Low (OS-protected) |
| **Workspace Files** | Read connection configs | Low |
| **Output Panel** | Log network activity | Low |

**Mitigation**: All permissions are necessary for core functionality and follow VSCode best practices.

### 2. AI Data Transmission

When AI features are enabled, query structure is sent to VSCode Language Model API.

**What's Sent**: Templated queries (e.g., `SELECT * FROM <table:users> WHERE <col:id> = ?`)
**What's NOT Sent**: Actual data values, credentials, query results

**Mitigation**:
- AI disabled by default (opt-in)
- Query templating protects sensitive values
- Users can disable: `"mydba.ai.enabled": false`
- Full details in [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md)

### 3. Database Credentials

Credentials are stored using VSCode SecretStorage API, which uses OS-level encryption:

- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (libsecret)

**Risk**: If an attacker has access to your OS user account, they may access stored credentials.

**Mitigation**:
- Use OS-level security (FileVault, BitLocker, etc.)
- Use strong OS passwords
- Lock your computer when away
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 4. SSH Tunneling

MyDBA supports SSH tunneling, which requires SSH private keys.

**Risk**: SSH keys are stored in SecretStorage but are loaded into memory during connection.

**Mitigation**:
- Use passphrase-protected SSH keys
- Use SSH key agents when possible
- Rotate SSH keys regularly
- Limit SSH key permissions on servers

### 5. Query Result Data

Query results are displayed in VSCode webviews and stored in memory.

**Risk**: Query results may contain sensitive data visible in the UI.

**Mitigation**:
- Sensitive column warnings: `"mydba.security.warnSensitiveColumns": true`
- Auto-redaction: `"mydba.security.redactSensitiveColumns": true`
- Results never sent to AI
- Use read-only database users when possible
