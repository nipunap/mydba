## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Status | Security Fixes Until | Full Support Until |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1.0.x (beta) | ‚úÖ Current | TBD (targeting GA Q1 2026) | TBD |
| 0.x.x (alpha) | ‚ùå EOL | 2025-11-30 | 2025-09-30 |

**Current Version**: 1.0.0-beta.1 ([Releases](https://github.com/nipunap/mydba/releases))

**Support Policy**: After GA release, the last 2 minor versions will receive security fixes for 6 months after the next release.

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest stable version to benefit from the latest security patches.

### Database GA Support Policy

MyDBA supports only GA (Generally Available) database versions:

| Database | Supported |
|----------|-----------|
| MySQL | 8.0+, 8.4, 9.x+ |
| MariaDB | 10.6 LTS, 10.11 LTS, 11.x+ |

EOL versions such as MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.4/10.5 are not supported. This policy reduces security risk and enables Performance Schema‚Äìbased profiling recommended by MySQL.

### Cloud IAM Least-Privilege (AWS RDS/Aurora)

- Use `rds-db:connect` with scoped DB resource ARNs for IAM authentication.
- Optional: retrieval of secrets via AWS Secrets Manager requires only `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` for specific ARNs.
- Do not grant wildcard privileges. Scope policies per environment and account.

### Dependency Hygiene

- Monthly dependency audit (`npm audit`, Snyk)
- Quarterly threat model review covering AI data flows, webviews, and database adapters

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Credential Management

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Use VSCode SecretStorage for credentials (automatic in MyDBA)
- Enable SSH tunneling for remote connections
- Use SSL/TLS for database connections
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use read-only database users when possible

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Store passwords in workspace settings
- Share connection profiles with credentials
- Commit connection configs to Git
- Use production credentials in development

#### 2. AI Features

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Review the AI data handling section in this document before enabling AI
- Enable anonymization: `"mydba.ai.anonymizeData": true`
- Use `confirmBeforeSend` for sensitive environments
- Disable AI entirely for HIPAA/PCI-DSS data: `"mydba.ai.enabled": false`

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Send production queries to AI without anonymization
- Include PII in queries when AI is enabled
- Use AI features on databases with regulated data (unless reviewed by compliance)

#### 3. Network Security

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Verify SSL certificates: `"mydba.ssl.rejectUnauthorized": true`
- Use firewalls to restrict database access
- Monitor the network activity log: `View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí MyDBA - Network`
- Use VPN or SSH tunnels for remote databases

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Disable SSL certificate validation in production
- Expose database ports to the public internet
- Ignore network activity warnings

#### 4. Extension Updates

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Enable auto-updates in VSCode
- Review release notes for security fixes
- Update promptly when security patches are released
- Subscribe to security advisories

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Ignore update notifications
- Pin to old versions without a reason
- Disable extension updates

#### 5. Development Environment Security

When using MyDBA with test databases (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`):

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Use non-root database users in containers
- Keep test data separate from production
- Rotate test credentials regularly
- Use `.env` files for secrets (gitignored)
- Stop containers when not in use
- Use specific version tags (not `latest`)

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Use production credentials in Docker containers
- Expose database ports to 0.0.0.0 unnecessarily
- Commit database credentials to Git
- Share test environments without sanitizing data
- Use default passwords (mysql root/password)

**Docker Security Example**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.test.yml
services:
  mysql-test:
    image: mysql:8.0.35  # Specific version, not 'latest'
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}  # From .env file
      MYSQL_USER: testuser  # Non-root user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"  # Bind to localhost only
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
```

### For Contributors

#### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input
   - Sanitize data before SQL queries (use parameterized queries)
   - Validate configuration values

2. **Credential Handling**
   - Never log credentials (even in debug mode)
   - Use VSCode SecretStorage API exclusively
   - Wipe credentials from memory after use
   - Never include credentials in error messages

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
   - Never concatenate user input into SQL
   - Validate table/column names against schema

   **Good** (Parameterized Query):
   ```typescript
   const result = await connection.query(
     'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
     [userId]
   );
   ```

   **Bad** (SQL Injection Risk):
   ```typescript
   const result = await connection.query(
     `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`  // ‚ùå SQL injection risk
   );
   ```

   **Schema Validation** (Prevent Table Name Injection):
   ```typescript
   // Validate table names against allowed list
   const ALLOWED_TABLES = ['users', 'posts', 'comments', 'sessions'];

   function validateTableName(tableName: string): void {
     if (!ALLOWED_TABLES.includes(tableName)) {
       throw new Error(`Invalid table name: ${tableName}`);
     }
   }

   // Use in queries
   validateTableName(userProvidedTable);
   const result = await connection.query(
     `SELECT * FROM ${userProvidedTable} WHERE id = ?`,
     [userId]
   );
   ```

   **Column Name Validation**:
   ```typescript
   // Validate against schema
   async function validateColumn(table: string, column: string): Promise<boolean> {
     const schema = await getTableSchema(table);
     return schema.columns.includes(column);
   }
   ```

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Run `npm audit` before every PR
   - Keep dependencies up-to-date
   - Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities
   - Use Snyk or similar tools for scanning

5. **Secrets in Code**
   - Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
   - Scan commits with `git-secrets` or similar tools

6. **Webview Security**
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Sanitize HTML content
   - Avoid `eval()` or dynamic code execution
   - Validate all messages from webviews

---

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. VSCode Extension Permissions

MyDBA requires the following VSCode permissions:

| Permission | Why Needed | Risk Level |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Network Access** | Connect to databases, AI API | Medium |
| **SecretStorage** | Store credentials securely | Low (OS-protected) |
| **Workspace Files** | Read connection configs | Low |
| **Output Panel** | Log network activity | Low |

**Mitigation**: All permissions are necessary for core functionality and follow VSCode best practices.

### 2. AI Data Transmission

When AI features are enabled, query structure may be sent to configured AI providers for analysis.

#### Supported AI Providers

MyDBA supports multiple AI providers (configured via `mydba.ai.provider`):

1. **VSCode Language Model API** (default, auto-detected)
   - Includes GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Anthropic via VSCode
   - Subject to VSCode and provider terms

2. **OpenAI** (GPT-4o-mini default)
   - Requires API key
   - Direct API communication

3. **Anthropic** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet default)
   - Requires API key
   - Direct API communication

4. **Ollama** (Local)
   - Runs entirely on your machine
   - No external data transmission

#### What Data Is Sent

**Default Configuration** (`mydba.ai.anonymizeQueries: true`):
- Query structure with templated values: `SELECT * FROM <table:users> WHERE <col:id> = ?`
- Table/column names (schema metadata) if `includeSchemaContext: true`
- Query execution plans (EXPLAIN output)

**What's NEVER Sent**:
- Actual data values from query results
- Database credentials (passwords, tokens)
- Connection details (hosts, ports, usernames)
- SSH keys or passphrases

#### Data Retention & Processing

- **VSCode LM API**: Subject to provider's data retention policy (GitHub/OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **Direct API Calls**: Subject to OpenAI/Anthropic data retention policies
- **Ollama**: Data never leaves your machine
- **Regional Processing**: May involve cross-border data transfer depending on provider
- **Audit Trail**: All AI requests logged locally in VSCode Output panel (if `network.showActivityLog: true`)

#### Configuration & Control

**AI is enabled by default but requires provider configuration on first use.**

Disable AI entirely:
```json
"mydba.ai.enabled": false
```

Require confirmation before sending:
```json
"mydba.ai.confirmBeforeSend": true
```

Disable schema context:
```json
"mydba.ai.includeSchemaContext": false
```

#### Compliance Implications

- **GDPR**: AI processing may constitute data transfer outside EU - review provider DPAs
- **HIPAA**: Not HIPAA-compliant - disable AI for PHI databases
- **PCI-DSS**: Not certified - do not use on payment card databases without additional controls
- **Best Practice**: Disable AI in production environments with regulated data

### 3. Database Credentials

Credentials are stored using VSCode SecretStorage API, which uses OS-level encryption:

- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (libsecret)

**Risk**: If an attacker has access to your OS user account, they may access stored credentials.

**Mitigation**:
- Use OS-level security (FileVault, BitLocker, etc.)
- Use strong OS passwords
- Lock your computer when away
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 4. SSH Tunneling

MyDBA supports SSH tunneling for secure remote database connections.

#### SSH Key Storage

**Storage Method**:
- Full SSH private key content is stored in VSCode SecretStorage (encrypted at rest)
- Stored as `mydba.connection.<connectionId>.sshKey`
- OS-level encryption (Keychain/Credential Manager/libsecret)

**Memory Handling**:
- Private keys loaded into memory only during active connection
- Keys cleared from memory when connection is closed
- No disk caching of unencrypted keys

**Risk**: If an attacker gains access to your OS user account, they may extract SSH keys from SecretStorage.

**Mitigation**:
- Use passphrase-protected SSH keys (passphrase stored separately in SecretStorage)
- Use SSH key agents when possible (reduces key exposure)
- Rotate SSH keys regularly (quarterly recommended)
- Limit SSH key permissions on servers (restrict to specific IPs/commands)
- Enable OS-level security (FileVault, BitLocker, disk encryption)

### 5. Query Result Data

Query results are displayed in VSCode webviews and stored in memory.

**Risk**: Query results may contain sensitive data visible in the UI.

**Mitigation**:
- Sensitive column warnings: `"mydba.security.warnSensitiveColumns": true`
- Auto-redaction: `"mydba.security.redactSensitiveColumns": true`
- Results never sent to AI
- Use read-only database users when possible

### 6. Resource Limits & Rate Limiting

MyDBA implements several resource limits to prevent accidental damage and resource exhaustion.

#### Query Limits

**Result Set Limits**:
- Preview queries: 1,000 rows max (`mydba.preview.maxRows`)
- Table data previews: 1,000 rows default
- Large result sets truncated with warning

**DML Operation Limits**:
- Max affected rows: 1,000 default (`mydba.dml.maxAffectRows`)
- Confirmation required when threshold exceeded
- Warning for UPDATE/DELETE without WHERE clause (`mydba.warnMissingWhereClause`)

**Query Execution**:
- Default timeout: 30 seconds (`mydba.queryTimeout`)
- Configurable per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Long-running queries can be cancelled

#### Connection Limits

**Concurrent Connections**:
- Max concurrent connections: 10 default (`mydba.maxConnections`)
- Prevents connection pool exhaustion
- Alerts at 80% usage (`mydba.metrics.connectionUsageWarning`)

#### AI Rate Limiting

**Current Status**: No hard rate limits enforced
**Future Plans**: Rate limiting for AI API calls to prevent cost overruns
**Manual Control**: Disable AI or use `confirmBeforeSend` for granular control

#### Safety Features

- **Safe Mode**: Enabled by default (`mydba.safeMode`)
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview queries without execution (`mydba.dryRunMode`)
- **Destructive Operation Confirmation**: Required for DROP/TRUNCATE/DELETE/UPDATE (`mydba.confirmDestructiveOperations`)

## Compliance Considerations

MyDBA processes database metadata and query structures. Depending on your regulatory requirements, additional controls may be necessary.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Scope**: EU data protection law

**MyDBA's Role**:
- **Data Processor**: When AI features are enabled, MyDBA processes query metadata
- **Data Controller**: Users are data controllers for their database connections

**Key Considerations**:
- AI features may transfer query structure to providers outside the EU
- Schema metadata (table/column names) may be shared with AI providers
- No personal data from query results is sent to AI (results stay local)

**Compliance Actions**:
- Review AI provider Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
- Disable AI if operating under strict GDPR requirements: `"mydba.ai.enabled": false`
- Use Ollama (local AI) for EU data residency requirements
- Document data flows in your processing records

**Article 28 Requirements**: If using AI providers, ensure they meet GDPR processor requirements

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

**Scope**: US healthcare data protection

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MyDBA is NOT HIPAA-compliant**

**Restrictions**:
- **Do NOT** enable AI features when working with PHI (Protected Health Information)
- **Do NOT** use MyDBA on databases containing ePHI without a Business Associate Agreement
- VSCode SecretStorage is not certified for HIPAA compliance

**Safe Usage with PHI**:
```json
{
  "mydba.ai.enabled": false,
  "mydba.security.redactSensitiveColumns": true,
  "mydba.telemetry.enabled": false
}
```

**Recommendation**: Use MyDBA only for development/testing environments, not production PHI databases

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

**Scope**: Payment card data protection

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MyDBA is NOT PCI-DSS certified**

**Restrictions**:
- **Do NOT** use on databases containing cardholder data (CHD) without additional controls
- **Do NOT** enable AI features on PCI scope databases
- Database connections must use TLS 1.2+ (configure at database level)

**Additional Controls Required**:
- Dedicated connection profiles for PCI environments
- Audit logging of all queries (enable VSCode logging)
- Read-only database users where possible
- Network segmentation (SSH tunneling recommended)

**Compliance Mapping**:
- PCI-DSS 3.4: Credential encryption (SecretStorage meets requirement)
- PCI-DSS 4.1: Strong cryptography (TLS 1.2+ required at DB level)
- PCI-DSS 10.2: Audit trails (VSCode Output panel logs)

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control)

**Status**: MyDBA is a client-side extension with no hosted services

**SOC 2 Report**: Not available (N/A for client-side software)

**Trust Services Criteria**:
- **Security**: Covered by this security policy
- **Availability**: User-managed (VSCode extension)
- **Processing Integrity**: Query validation and limits
- **Confidentiality**: SecretStorage encryption
- **Privacy**: No data collection without consent (telemetry opt-in)

**For Enterprise Customers**:
- No SaaS component, no SOC 2 audit needed
- Review AI provider SOC 2 reports if using external AI
- Document extension in your system inventory

### ISO 27001 & Other Standards

**ISO 27001**: This security policy and threat model support ISO 27001 compliance
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Aligns with Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover functions
**CIS Controls**: Implements secure configuration (CIS Control 4), data protection (CIS Control 3)

### Compliance Summary Table

| Regulation | Status | Recommended Action |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **GDPR** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially compliant | Disable AI or use Ollama for EU data |
| **HIPAA** | ‚ùå Not compliant | Disable AI, use only in dev/test |
| **PCI-DSS** | ‚ùå Not certified | Additional controls required |
| **SOC 2** | N/A (client-side) | Review AI provider SOC 2 reports |
| **ISO 27001** | ‚úÖ Supports compliance | Follow security best practices |

### Compliance Recommendations

1. **Classify Your Environments**:
   - Development: All features enabled
   - Staging: AI with confirmation
   - Production (regulated): AI disabled

2. **Document Data Flows**:
   - Map what data MyDBA accesses
   - Document AI provider usage
   - Maintain audit trail

3. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Quarterly security configuration audit
   - Annual compliance assessment
